# FileFinder
FileFinder is an python3 application to find files or dir's or word's in text files.
This program is tested with python3.5 under Linux.

# Install
* First `git clone https://github.com/Mondei1/FileFinder.git`
* And then go in the directory with `cd FileFinder`
* Now, start the script with `python3.5 main.py`, you can use `python3.5 main.py ?` to see the syntax

You need `git` and `python3.5` installed! Do this with `sudo apt install python3.5 git`. But Python3.5 is pre-installed on most linux distros.
