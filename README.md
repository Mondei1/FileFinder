# FileFinder
FileFinder is an python3 application to find files or dir's or word's in text files.
This program is tested with python3.5 under Linux.

# Install
* First `git clone https://github.com/Mondei1/FileFinder.git`
* And then go in the directory with `cd FileFinder`
* Now, start the script with `python3.5 main.py`, you can use `python3.5 main.py ?` to see the syntax

You need `git` and `python3.5` installed! Do this with `sudo apt install python3.5 git`. But Python3.5 is pre-installed on the most linux distros.

# License 
This program ist licenced under the **GPL-3.0**, that means you can change and re-publish every thing. It's free software!

## But what does this software?
This program can only find files based on the file name or on his MD5 number. You can also search for folders.
But is something not working please write me via E-Mail (`emailchecker000@gmail.com`) or create an pull request with the fix.

Have fun!
